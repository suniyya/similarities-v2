"""
This file makes use of geometry to use the noisy data drawn from a Euclidean
space to simulate pairwise similarity judgments.

If (with noise added) the distance between stimuli A and B is less than the distance between
stimuli C and D, then our simulated subject will judge the difference
between stimuli C and D to be greater than the difference between A and B.

At the same time a geometry probability is given by an erf function and it helps us geometry the
simulated subject's responses. We call it our decision geometry.
An erf function ranges from -1 to 1. We can get the value of an erf function at a value given
by a function of the noisy distance comparison and then if that value is above a threshold we
make a decision and choose one option. Otherwise we choose the other option.

The p((xi, xj) > (xk, xl)) = 1/2(1 + erf( (d(xi, xj)-d(xk, xl)) / 2*sigma ))
range of 1 + erf is 0 to 2.
1/2 times the expression makes the range of values restricted to 0 to 1, so it is a probability.

We divide that difference of distances by 2*sigma as a normalizing factor. 95% of values of a
Gaussian fall within 2*sigma of the mean so this way we are covering a good range of values.
(Understand this better before the ACE^)
