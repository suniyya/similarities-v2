### README (Notes for Self)

The radius of the circle has been kept at 6.1cm on my screen. From a viewing distance of 57 cm it subtends a visual angle of 6.1 degrees. Each stimulus subtends an angle of ~2.25 degrees. Viewing distance must be adjusted so that these visual angles are the same across subjects.
